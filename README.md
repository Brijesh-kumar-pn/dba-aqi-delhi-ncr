# Analysis and Prediction of Air Quality in Delhi–NCR (2018–2023)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes daily AQI levels across five CPCB monitoring stations in Delhi–NCR from 2018 to 2023. The study applies statistical testing and machine learning methods to:

- Examine seasonal variation
- Evaluate spatial heterogeneity
- Assess COVID-19 structural impact
- Develop predictive AQI models

## Dataset
- Source: Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)
- Period: 2018–2023
- Observations: 10,924
- Target Variable: Daily_MAX_AQI

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Statistical Testing (ANOVA, t-test)
4. Random Forest Regression Modeling

## Model Performance
- RMSE ≈ 95.6
- MAE ≈ 73.9
- R² ≈ 0.45

## Repository Structure
- `data/` – Dataset files
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter analysis notebook
- `figures/` – Visual outputs
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies
